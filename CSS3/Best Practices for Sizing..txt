For Web.

It's best to use "rem" for the majority of sizing cases. 
"rem" inherits it's size relative to the size of the root element. 
In our case this is "<html>".

Setting the font-size of the html element to 10px and using rem sizing for divs, padding, and margins
is best practice. 

HOWEVER, some browser's default font-size may be higher, and overwriting the default font-size in
that scenario is going to provide a bad user-experience. Like-wise, those who have manually changed
their own font-size for accessibility reasons will also be affected negatively.

The solution is to use a font-size for the HTML element set to 62.5%, as this will result in a value 
equal to 10px while preserving font-size and responsive design for users with higher default "px".


VH, and VW may be useful and tempting to use but are not recommended now to do some weird behaviour.

Certain media queries may benefit from "em" spacing based on their parent element, because of some issues
that arise occasionally using "rem" sizing on safari.
