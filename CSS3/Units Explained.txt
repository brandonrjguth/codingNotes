RELATIVE UNITS

%               = Percentage prelative to the same propert of the parent element.

em              = Relative to the font size of the element.

rem             = Relative to the font size of the root element.

ex              = Relative to the x-height of the font.


ABSOLUTE UNITS

cm, mm, in      = Self explanatory, used in print.
px              = pixels. duh.
vw, vh          = % of viewport, but you don't get to use these because browsers are stupid and it's too
                 unreliable to be used commercially.


There are more but none of them matter and by the time you ever need to use them you'll have forgotten 
anyways and will have to look to google anyways.
